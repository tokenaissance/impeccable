//! What the hit-test stack says about the layers at a run of text.
//!
//! The contrast walk reads the element's ancestors and answers with the
//! first surface on that chain. Two kinds of layer never appear there, and
//! both make its verdict about something a reader does not see:
//!
//! - a layer **above** the text that hides it: a fixed cookie banner over the
//!   hero stats, a photo avatar laid over an SVG initial. The text is covered
//!   at capture and there is nothing to score.
//! - paint **under** the text that is nobody's ancestor fill: a sibling photo
//!   under a hero subline, a slideshow image under a title, an SVG circle under
//!   an initial, a dark positioned panel under a tab strip. The walk passes
//!   under it and lands on the page ground or on a card further out.
//!
//! Not every layer under the text is a surface. A dot grid, hairline grid
//! lines, a grain tile, a masked or faint decoration laid over a section
//! leaves the surface the walk named where it was, and the verdict stands.
//! Paint under the text sets the verdict aside only where it could really
//! change what the text sits on: a picture, or a gradient or fill whose
//! colours differ from the named surface, or paint whose colours cannot be
//! read where the walk only reached the page ground. A layer this cannot place
//! either way keeps the verdict.
//!
//! [`layers_at_text`] asks `elementsFromPoint` at the points the occlusion
//! grid already asks for the same box ([`occlusion_probe_points`]), so a live
//! scan answers them in the same round and a recording made for that check
//! answers them on replay. The layers are not modelled: this says only whether
//! the walk's verdict is about the text a reader meets, and leaves the verdict
//! alone wherever it cannot tell.
