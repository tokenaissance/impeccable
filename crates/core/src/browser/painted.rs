//! Whether an element is painted at capture time.
//!
//! The element pass measures text and images from their computed style and
//! their box. A box can carry a real measurement and still show nothing: a
//! mobile submenu held at zero width, the cells of a horizontal scroller past
//! its visible edge, an animated demo step that has not played, a poster at
//! opacity 0 over a playing video. A reader cannot see any of those at rest,
//! so a rule that scores what a reader sees has nothing to score.
//!
//! [`unpainted_at_capture`] is the one predicate every such rule shares, and
//! the driver applies it to the rules [`paint_gate`] names. It reads only what
//! the element pass already reads (style, rects, scroll metrics,
//! `checkVisibility`) and walks the ancestor chain once, so its cost is
//! bounded by the depth of the element, and the driver asks it only for
//! elements that produced a gated finding.
//!
//! Besides what hides a box, the predicate knows what hides the paint inside
//! one: fallback content of a media element, a face turned away under
//! `backface-visibility: hidden`, and for the Text gate text set under 1px.
//! A placeholder inked transparent is skipped where the placeholder is
//! scored, and a word part way through a scripted colour reveal where its
//! contrast is ([`colour_mid_reveal`]).
//!
//! What it cannot decide it keeps: a property or metric the capture did not
//! record (a snapshot older than the measurement) never removes a finding.
//!
//! Rules that name an element other than the one they report on, or that report
//! on the page, ask the predicate about it themselves: `clipped-overflow-container`
//! about the positioned child it names ([`unpainted_inside`], which leaves the
//! container's own clip to the rule) and about the container
//! ([`unpainted_text_box`]), `side-tab`'s border path about the card
//! ([`unpainted_text_box`]), `nested-cards` about the inner card,
//! `kicker-above-heading` about the heading and the label above it,
//! `text-occlusion` about the covered text, the text or box covering it and
//! the card a headline overhangs, and the page-level CSS-text forms in
//! [`PAINT_GATED_PAGE_FORMS`] about the elements their selector matches.
//!
//! `content-hidden-at-rest` is deliberately not gated: hidden text is what it
//! reports.
