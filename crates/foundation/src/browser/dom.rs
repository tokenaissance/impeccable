//! The DOM probe the browser rules run against.
//!
//! The in-page bundle keeps only measurement in JavaScript: every rule that
//! used to be a `checkElement*DOM` / `check*DOM` adapter in `checks.mjs` and
//! the driver in `browser/injected/index.mjs` is Rust code written against
//! this trait. The wasm crate implements it by calling back into a small JS
//! probe object (element handles are indexes into a JS-side registry); unit
//! tests implement it with [`super::fake_dom::FakeDom`].
//!
//! Semantics mirror the DOM APIs the JS called, one method per API, so a
//! ported function reads like the source: `dom.style(el, "fontSize")` is
//! `getComputedStyle(el).fontSize`, `dom.closest(el, sel)` is
//! `el.closest(sel)`, and so on. Where the JS wrapped a call in `try/catch`
//! (invalid selectors), the method returns `Result` and the caller keeps the
//! same fallback.
