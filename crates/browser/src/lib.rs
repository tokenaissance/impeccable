//! impeccable-browser: the URL engine of `impeccable detect`, ported from
//! `cli/engine/engines/browser/detect-url.mjs` (+ `engines/visual/
//! screenshot-contrast.mjs`). Instead of puppeteer it discovers an installed
//! Chromium-based browser ([`discovery`]), drives it over CDP ([`cdp`]) with
//! puppeteer's launch flags and page setup, and — since triage D2 — injects
//! only the plain-JS snapshot producer, runs the rule core natively over
//! [`impeccable_core::browser::snapshot::SnapshotDom`] ([`snapshot_engine`]),
//! and maps the findings into [`Finding`]s exactly as `detectUrl` does. No
//! WebAssembly runs next to the page, so the scan no longer needs
//! `Page.setBypassCSP` and a strict-CSP site is scanned passively (see
//! WASM-BUNDLE.md in the detector repo).
//!
//! Wired into `impeccable detect` through [`impeccable_detect::UrlEngine`]:
//! a single URL uses `detect_url` (`waitUntil: 'networkidle0'`, `settleMs:
//! 0`); several URLs share one browser through [`SharedBrowser`]
//! (`createBrowserDetector()`: `waitUntil: 'load'`, `settleMs: 100`).
//!
//! Before any rule runs, the loaded page is classified ([`validity`]): a bot
//! challenge, an HTTP error page, or a page that is only a consent wall is
//! refused with an error instead of being scanned and reported clean. Then
//! the banners of known consent managers are hidden ([`consent`]), and so are
//! known product tours, builder badges and preloaders still covering the page
//! ([`overlays`]), so every pass and the screenshot see the page a visitor
//! sees once they dismiss them.
//!
//! Two entry points serve measurement work rather than the CLI.
//! [`detect_url_evidence`] runs the same scan and also returns what a
//! reviewer needs to check the findings (the captures and hit-test answers,
//! element rects, a screenshot). [`replay_url_scan`] re-runs the deterministic
//! passes over a recorded capture with no browser, so a rule change can be
//! measured against saved pages.
