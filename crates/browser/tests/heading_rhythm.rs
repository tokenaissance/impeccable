//! `heading-rhythm` over `tests/fixtures/antipatterns/heading-rhythm.html`,
//! rendered by an installed browser. Skips cleanly when there is none.
//!
//! The should-pass column holds the shapes a live recapture of real sites
//! misread once the rule pass ran after the reveal sweep: an eyebrow wrapped
//! in its own box, a block that ends in a rule, an accordion trigger that ends
//! its row, a caption under its photo, a title band that draws its own rules,
//! and a standfirst behind a `display: contents` wrapper. Round 7 adds labels
//! at body size set apart by colour, italics or a hairline weight when they
//! open the box that holds the heading, and a band painted with a background
//! image that covers it; a link or date closing the block above and a
//! heading's own icon or accent bar keep reporting. Round 7's equal-gaps
//! call (r7-t1) reports a heading spaced evenly under running prose, and an
//! even gap under one line or with more room above still passes.
