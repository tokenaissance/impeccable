## Recorded 2026-08-17: the engine names its own commands

The JS scripts printed their own file names in usage lines, directives, and
the hook manifests they wrote. The binary prints the verb (`impeccable doctor`)
or the launcher path (`"<scripts>/impeccable" hook`). Each case below was
re-recorded from the engine after a line-level review confirmed the only change
is that wording; behavior, exit codes, and every other byte are unchanged.

- `doctor-help`, `doctor-help-short`: `Usage: node doctor.mjs …` is now `Usage: impeccable doctor [--json] [--fix] [--target <path>]`.
- `doctor-legacy-text`: the closing hint reads `Run \`<self> doctor --fix\``.
- `pin-usage-no-args`, `pin-usage-one-arg`: `Usage: impeccable pin <pin|unpin> <command>`.
- `surface-brief-usage`, `surface-brief-unknown`, `surface-brief-write-usage`: usage lines name `impeccable surface-brief`.
- `critique-usage`, `critique-unknown`: usage lines name `impeccable critique-storage`.
- `context-monorepo-target-missing`: MONOREPO_TARGET_REQUIRED says `impeccable context ran without --target`.
- `hadmin-on`, `hadmin-on-twice`, `hadmin-off-then-status`, `hadmin-on-repairs-existing-manifest`, `hadmin-on-malformed-manifest-backup`: `hooks on` writes manifests that run the launcher (`"<scripts>/impeccable" hook`, Cursor `hook-before-edit`) instead of `node "<scripts>/hook.mjs"`.
- `hook-session-fresh-then-pending-then-stop`, `hook-session-two-sessions`, `hbe-denial-downgrade-after-6`: the short footer names `impeccable hooks ignore-value`.
- `live-help`, `live-accept-help`, `live-inject-help`, `live-insert-help`, `live-server-help`, `live-resume-help`, `live-commit-help`, `live-discard-help`, `live-complete-help`, `live-complete-no-id`: usage text names `impeccable live*` verbs.
- `live-server-already-running`, `live-daemon-server-status-poll-complete`, `live-status-empty`, `live-status-generating`, `live-status-many-sessions`, `live-status-stale-server-json`, `live-status-legacy-sessions-dir`, `live-status-from-subdir`, `live-status-manual-apply`, `live-resume-manual-apply`, `live-status-mount-failed`, `live-resume-mount-failed`, `live-resume-generating`, `live-resume-by-id`, `live-resume-first-active-sorted`, `live-resume-accept-requested`, `live-resume-carbonize-required`: recovery hints and next-command lines spell `<self> live-poll` / `live-server` / `live-complete` / `live-commit-manual-edits` instead of the `.mjs` names.

## Recorded 2026-08-17: live-inject adds `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to a CSP meta script-src

The detector the live overlay loads from the helper origin is a WebAssembly
module in the engine (its `docs/WASM-BUNDLE.md`); a `script-src` that names the
origin but not `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` still refuses to compile it. The JS
`patchCspMeta` predates the wasm bundle and appended only the origin.

- `live-inject-csp-meta-no-connect-src`: the patched `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` reads `script-src 'self' http://localhost:8412 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` (was `script-src 'self' http://localhost:8412`). The `data-impeccable-csp-original` marker, the `connect-src` and `img-src` additions, idempotence, and the revert on unpatch are unchanged. `live-inject-vite-csp-meta` and `live-inject-next-jsx` carry meta tags the patch does not touch, so their goldens did not move.

## Recorded 2026-08-31: detector-engine ports landed, gap goldens restored

The section previously here pinned the gap between main's post-freeze detector
fixes and the engine. Those fixes are now ported (engine repo commits:
`c0aa75f` oklch in visual-contrast/neon-text, upstream 1b7da15b #592;
`5cdeec8` color-mix nested hex, upstream 54440319 #578; the 1D grid fix,
upstream a236137b #615, rode along in `9046e8f` via a concurrent staging race;
`6d36231` comment stripping for regex matchers, upstream 067665cc #589 +
ddb60993 + ba873f75 + 9a7d0fbc; `33aef88` root-relative linked stylesheets,
upstream 2b88aa52 #652 + daae1d41; `6d0ecf1` URL userinfo redaction with
origin-scoped basic auth, upstream d5873ff8 + d690349d #657; `09f8ae7` inert
exact ignore-value refusal, upstream be87f5eb #662; `20c8347` the
comp-fidelity rules organic-clip-path and buried-raster, upstream 58561610).
The affected goldens were re-recorded from the fixed engine and each json
fixture golden was byte-verified against the last JS engine state in history
(`db1462b9^`, which carries both main's drift and the comp-fidelity rules):

- Moved to post-fix behavior: `detect-fixture-json-codex-grid-1d-pass-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-codex-grid-1d-pass-html` (no finding, exit 0),
  `detect-fixture-json-organic-clip-path-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-organic-clip-path-html`,
  `detect-fixture-json-buried-raster-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-buried-raster-html` (the new rules fire),
  `detect-fixture-json-glow-html`, `detect-fixture-text-glow-html` (glow's
  `.photo-opaque-grad` column now carries its intended buried-raster finding),
  and the sweeps `detect-dir-json-all-fixtures`, `detect-dir-text-all-fixtures`,
  `detect-dir-quiet-all-fixtures`, `detect-no-advisory-json`,
  `detect-no-advisory-text`.
- Unchanged on re-record (already matched the fixed JS in the static engine):
  `detect-fixture-json-color-html`, `detect-fixture-text-color-html`,
  `detect-fixture-json-oklch-neon-text-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-oklch-neon-text-html` (the oklch and color-mix fixes
  observably change the browser-side visual-contrast path, which these static
  scans do not exercise), `detect-scope-type`, `detect-scope-both`.

The frozen call vectors for `checkHtmlPatterns`
(`tests/oracle/vectors/calls/rules.checks/checkHtmlPatterns.jsonl`) were
re-recorded the same way: args untouched, results replayed through the
`db1462b9^` JS (14 of 101 moved: the comp-fidelity scans and the
comment-stripping/inline-fragment fixes to `enclosingCssSelector`). No case in
this section is an accepted delta any more; the engine matches the final JS.

## Recorded 2026-08-31: main's Aug 17-31 verb fixes ported to the engine, goldens re-recorded

The goldens below froze pre-fix behavior. Each fix landed on main in JS and
was ported to the engine; the cases were re-recorded from the binary and
reviewed line by line, so they now pin the fixed behavior.

- `hook-session-fresh-then-pending-then-stop`, `hook-session-two-sessions`: the Stop deep pass syncs the remembered set to the live scan, including findings the per-edit pass already surfaced, so a second Stop with nothing new is silent and a fixed-then-reintroduced finding fires again (upstream 3c442af7).
- `hadmin-on`, `hadmin-on-twice`, `hadmin-off-then-status`, `hadmin-on-repairs-existing-manifest`, `hadmin-on-malformed-manifest-backup`: the Claude manifests `hooks on` writes match on `Edit|Write` and the description names the current tools; Claude Code folded multi-edit behavior into Edit (upstream 7d5c60d2).
- `live-commit-mock-unreported-file-change`: the rollback-failure results share one constructor, which moved `unreportedFiles` and `notes` after `pageUrl` in the emitted JSON (upstream 1f2c3f9d).

## Recorded 2026-08-31: main's Sep-1 verb fixes ported after the rust-swap rebase

Five more fixes landed on main in JS between the swap branch and its rebase.
Each was ported to the engine and the affected goldens re-recorded from the
binary after a line-level review; the engine's output was also diffed
byte-for-byte against the upstream JS on the same inputs before recording.

- `critique-usage`, `critique-unknown`: the usage line now lists the new `close` subcommand (upstream 5211bdf4, #660).
- `critique-latest-existing`: `latest` applies the #660 identity/freshness path: a legacy snapshot carrying no fingerprint for a concrete local target is closed and `latest` exits 2 instead of printing the stale body (upstream 5211bdf4, #660).
- `critique-write-then-read`: `write` stamps `target_identity`/`target_fingerprint`/`target_path`, uses a fixed-width `~NNNN` collision suffix when two snapshots share a UTC second, `latest` freshness-closes the read snapshot, and `trend` now surfaces the `closed` flag and identity fields (upstream 5211bdf4, #660).
- `critique-write-monorepo-child`: `write` stamps the resolved `target_identity`, and a `latest` run from a sibling app resolves to a different identity so it exits 2 rather than returning the neighbor's backlog (upstream 5211bdf4, #660).
- `detect-fixture-json-overused-font-html`, `detect-fixture-text-overused-font-html`: new fixture added on the swap branch; overused-font primary selection now skips only the CSS generics, so a system stack keeps its system face as primary and later web-font fallbacks like Roboto no longer flag (upstream 2cfd6076, #678).
- `detect-dir-json-all-fixtures`, `detect-dir-text-all-fixtures`, `detect-dir-quiet-all-fixtures`, `detect-scope-type`, `detect-scope-both`, `detect-no-advisory-json`, `detect-no-advisory-text`: the directory sweep picks up the new overused-font fixture and the #678 primary-face change (upstream 2cfd6076, #678).

## Recorded 2026-08-31: E8 hook-manifest self-heal on upgrade

Two new cases pin the fix for triage E8 (the v3-to-launcher upgrade path). The
JS `automaticHookMode` counted any hook command naming the skill as an active
hook, including the JS-era `node .../hook.mjs` form. After a skill update the
`.mjs` script no longer exists, so that manifest points at a dead command yet
still suppressed `MANUAL_DETECTOR_REQUIRED`, leaving the detector dark. The
engine now treats a manifest that names ONLY the `.mjs` form as not an active
launcher hook, so the manual detector fallback fires until install/update
repairs the manifest to the launcher form. The launcher form still counts as
active exactly as before. No existing golden moved: every other `context` case
runs under the `source` provider, whose manifest list is empty, so none of them
scan a hook manifest.

- `context-stale-hook-manifest`: a `.claude/settings.local.json` naming `node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/hook.mjs"` under the `claude-code` provider emits `MANUAL_DETECTOR_REQUIRED` (the stale marker no longer counts as active).
- `context-launcher-hook-active`: the same manifest in the launcher form (`"…/impeccable" hook`) suppresses `MANUAL_DETECTOR_REQUIRED`, confirming the launcher marker is still recognized as active.

## Recorded 2026-09-01: the harness stages workspaces at their real path

Two goldens were re-recorded after `stageWorkspace` started returning the
realpath of the staged directory. macOS's tmpdir is a symlink (`/var` ->
`/private/var`), and the old goldens carried that artifact rather than the
verbs' behavior; Linux, where the two paths are the same, never reproduced
them. The binary's output is unchanged; the input the harness fed it is.

- `context-dir-override`: `productPath` is `elsewhere/PRODUCT.md`, the plain relative path, instead of `../../../../../../..<WS>/elsewhere/PRODUCT.md` (a relative path from the symlinked cwd to the resolved one).
- `live-accept-source-locked`: the accept now reports `source_locked`, which is what the case is named for. The staged lock named the file under the symlinked path, so the verb never matched it against its own resolved path and the old golden recorded a successful accept.

`context-lowercase-product-name` runs only on case-insensitive hosts
(`platforms: ['darwin', 'win32']` in the case): `product.md` is found through
the canonical name there and through the fallback scan elsewhere, both right.

## Recorded 2026-09-03: #710 resolves an explicit target at its own git boundary

Upstream `672ca296` (#710) scopes an explicit `--target` to its own repository.
A route-shaped target that begins with `/` is an absolute path outside the
workspace, so route cases that used to resolve inside the fixture now resolve
against the filesystem root. Every case below was re-recorded after confirming
`origin/main`'s `context.mjs` / `surface-brief.mjs` produce the same stdout and
the same exit code for the same run.

- `context-full-target-route`, `surface-brief-path-slash`, `surface-brief-path-outside`, `surface-brief-read-route`: stdout and exit code match origin/main byte for byte; nothing here is a delta beyond the upstream change itself.
- `surface-brief-write-route`: the write now fails on both engines (exit 1) because `/.impeccable/surfaces` is not writable. Node reports `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/.impeccable/surfaces'`; the engine reports the failed write as `No such file or directory (os error 2)`. Same failure, different wording for an unwritable filesystem root.

## Recorded 2026-09-03: the OpenCode pinned command names the launcher

Upstream `9736a9f6` (#483) makes `pin` write an OpenCode slash-command bridge
whose body tells the agent to run `node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs`.
The engine names its own command everywhere else the launcher replaced a
script path (see the 2026-08-17 section above), so the bridge says
`<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable context` instead. Nothing else in the
file, the file set, or the printed lines differs from the JS.

- `pin-opencode-project`, `pin-opencode-user-scope`, `pin-opencode-skips-foreign-command`, `pin-opencode-then-unpin`, `pin-opencode-unpin-skips-foreign`.


## Recorded 2026-09-04: `--version` follows the npm package to 4.0.0

The npm shim answers `--version` / `-v` itself from its own `package.json`
(docs/CLI-CONTRACT.md), so the number users see tracks the package they
installed. The binary's `CLI_VERSION` moves from `3.6.0` to `4.0.0` with the
CLI 4.0.0 release; it is what the binary prints when run directly.

- `cli-version`.
